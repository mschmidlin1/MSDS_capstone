# Python Tradebot using alpaca-py

A trade bot that trades stocks based on different trading algorithms. This was created by myself (Michael Schmidlin) as a capstone project for a Masters in Data Science from University of Denver.

# Project Scope
- The application will be programmed in python
- The application should run on the cloud (AWS or similar) for stability
- The application will use multiple different algorithms to trade<br> 
                        * One will be a basic high frequency trading algorithm<br>
                        * One will be a basic long term strategy algorithm<br>
                        * One will be a deep NN (most likely RNN)<br>
- The bot should have stop losses so that it can't loose too much money
- Prolificity target: The bot will turn \$10 into \$1,000 in one month


## How to use
1.) Clone the repo.<br>
2.) run `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
3.) specify other arguments.<br>
Other arguments:<br>
`arg1` - does this thing<br>


Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.



7. Add a License
For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.

The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/

Up to this point what we have covered are the minimum requirements for a good README. But you might also want to consider adding the following sections to make it more eye catching and interactive.

Additional README Sections
8. Badges
Badges aren't necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know that you know what you're doing.

Having this section can also be helpful to help link to important tools and also show some simple stats about your project like the number of forks, contributors, open issues etc...

Below is a screenshot from one of my projects that shows how you can make use of badges:
