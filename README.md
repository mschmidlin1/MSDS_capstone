# Python Tradebot using alpaca-py

A trade bot that trades stocks based on different trading algorithms. This was created by myself (Michael Schmidlin) as a capstone project for a Masters in Data Science from University of Denver.

# Project Scope
- The application will be programmed in python
- The application should run on the cloud (AWS or similar) for stability
- The application will use multiple different algorithms to trade<br> 
                        * One will be a basic high frequency trading algorithm<br>
                        * One will be a basic long term strategy algorithm<br>
                        * One will be a deep NN (most likely RNN)<br>
- The bot should have stop losses so that it can't loose too much money
- Prolificity target: The bot will turn \$10 into \$1,000 in one month


## How to use
1.) Clone the repo.<br>
2.) run `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
3.) specify other arguments.<br>
Other arguments:<br>
`arg1` - does this thing<br>


Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
