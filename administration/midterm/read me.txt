Professor, 

If you want to run any of the notebook, you will most likely need to make an account in order to have the proper API keys.

Everything else you would need to run the code is provided.

The the items imported from configs.py such as the logger are not needed so you can just delete those lines.

In addition, you don't need anything from the ALGO_crossover file so you can delete that import.


If all else fails I have included a pdf version of the notebook so running it should not be necessary.
